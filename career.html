                        was necessary, but I didn't know where to start. Eunice worked with me to imagine a new career and help me achieve clarity.
                        She is a great listener, a master at asking the million-dollar question, and a résumé guru. I've made a successful transition.
                        Eunice was born to do this kind of work!"</em>
