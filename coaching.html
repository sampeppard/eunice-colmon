                    <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>When you receive repeated complaints from clients or staff about a manager's interpersonal relationships, inability
                    to make decisions, lack of organization skills, inability to develop and/or leverage team talent, or other behaviors that lead to lowered morale and productivity, what you may need is performance improvement coaching.</p>
                    <p>Eunice eases the departmental leader’s concerns when you have a problem, may have had
                    failed attempts at correcting the problem, and may be running out of time or patience.</p>
                    <p>Eunice eases the concerns of department leaders the department leader’s concerns when you have a problem, may have had
                    failed attempts at correcting the problem, and there may have been failed attempts, and you may be running out of time or
                    patience.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Process & Experience</h2>
                    <p>A coaching engagement begins with a sponsor who needs a direct report to change a challenging behavior. Once we set clear
                    goals, the sponsor articulates this intent to the coaching client, secures agreement to the proposed engagement,
                    and is kept apprised of the coaching client's progress.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the confidential process, Eunice partners with each coaching client to explore internal and external forces that
                    are affecting self awareness, behavior, perceptions of others, and professional reputation. With guided intervention,
                    encouragement, and proven practical instruction, Eunice and the coaching client arrive at solutions, meet stated goals,
                    and enable real professional growth.</p>
                    <p>Positive results are imminent when you have a coach who provides an unbiased ear; responds with a confident, candid voice; offers a balance of rational, enlightening, actionable insights; and instills accountability for change. Eunice is that coach. She helps coaching clients 'want' to become better communicators, managers, and leaders, and ultimately, reach their goals.</p>
